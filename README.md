Purpose for this  program was to create a simple fun game, Tic Tac Toe. This game is command line program where the game takes place and its a two player game. The players will decide which piece they would like to choose and whoever gets 3 in a row, it will display a simple output of who won and terminate the game. Key concept in this I learned was the basic fundementals of python programming and how to create functions and call them.
